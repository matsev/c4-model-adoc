|Lines |Purpose

|3-6
|Trigger the action every time a https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#push[commit is pushed] to the `main` branch at GitHub.

|9
|Define the `build` job

|10
|Use Ubuntu as the GitHub runner environment.

|12-16
|Use the https://hub.docker.com/r/asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor/[asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor] image so that the AsciiDoctor tools are available during the build.

|18-20
|Define paths used during the build as environment variables.

|23-24
|The https://github.com/actions/checkout#readme[checkout action] is used by the GitHub workflow to checkout the source code.

|26-31
|Use the `asciidoctor` command to generate the docs as html in the `BUILD_PATH` directory.

|33-38
|Use the `asciidoctor-pdf` command to generate the docs as pdf in the `BUILD_PATH` directory.

|40-43
|Install https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync[rsync] and https://linux.die.net/man/1/tar[tar] since they are not available in the `asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor` image. `rsync` is used to copy the generated files to the `DEPLOY_PATH` directory and `tar` is used by the `upload-pages-artifact` action.

|45-46
|Package and upload the files by using https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact/#upload-pages-artifact[upload-pages-artifact]. This action packages the files in the format that is required by GitHub Pages and uploads them as an artifact.

|48-50
|Define the `upload` job that depends on the `build` job.

|53-55
|Grant permissions to the action to make a GitHub Pages deployment.

|58-60
|Define the `github-pages` environment and the url to the generated site.

|62-65
|Use the https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages#deploy-pages-[deploy-pages] action to deploy the artifact uploaded in the `build` job to GitHub Pages.
